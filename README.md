This analysis focuses on understanding customer churn patterns from a telecom dataset. The key insights are:

- Churn Rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned, prompting a need to investigate contributing factors.

- Demographics & Behavior:
  • Senior citizens show a higher churn rate compared to other groups.
  • Customers with short tenure (1 month) are significantly more likely to churn, whereas long-term users show higher retention.

- Contract Type Influence:
  • Churn is highly prevalent among customers with month-to-month contracts, compared to those on one or two-year contracts.

- Service Usage Trends:
  • Customers not using services like Online Security, Tech Support, or Online Backup show higher churn, indicating these features help retain customers.
  • Essential services such as Phone and Internet alone are not sufficient to ensure loyalty.

- Payment Method Impact:
  • Users who pay via Electronic Check are more likely to churn, possibly reflecting a less committed or tech-savvy segment.

These findings highlight the importance of customer engagement through bundled services, longer-term contracts, and targeted interventions for at-risk segments.
